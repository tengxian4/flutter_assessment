All the storylines have been completed. 
I have created one API to retrieve the contact lists. http://tengxian.pythonanywhere.com/ This is to mimic a real life situation. The generated random contact can be saved in the server but due to time limitation, I didn't do it. The list view also can be built using another file ending with ViewModel and ViewHolder.
